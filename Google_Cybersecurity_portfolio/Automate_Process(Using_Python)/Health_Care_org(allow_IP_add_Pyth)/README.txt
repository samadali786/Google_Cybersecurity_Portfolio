In this portfolio, as a Security Analys in Health Care company, I have to regularly update a file that identifies the employees who can access restricted content. the content of the file are based on who is working with the patient records, by assigning the IP addresses. I have given two lists one allow IP add list and the other remove IP address, I create the algorithm in Python that code to check whether the allow list contains any IP addresses identified on the remove list. If so, you should remove those IP addresses from the file containing the allow list, following are the files associated with this portfolio.
