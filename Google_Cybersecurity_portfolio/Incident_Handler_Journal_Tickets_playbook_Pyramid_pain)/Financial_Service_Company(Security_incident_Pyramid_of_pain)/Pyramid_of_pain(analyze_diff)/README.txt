In this part of my portfolio, as a Security Analyst of a financial service company I recieved an alert of the supsecious file being downloaded by an employee's computer, after investigating the alert, discover that the employee received an email containing an attachment. The attachment was a password-protected spreadsheet file. The spreadsheet's password was provided in the email. The employee downloaded the file, then entered the password to open the file. When the employee opened the file, a malicious payload was then executed on their computer. 

As a Security Analyst I create the hash of the file using SHA256sum in Linux CLI, so that no one can decrypt or open the file, further I scan the file hash in VirusTotal for further analysis of the file. and use the Pyramid of Pain to decide the difficulty to resolve this security incident files related to this portfolio is in this folder .
