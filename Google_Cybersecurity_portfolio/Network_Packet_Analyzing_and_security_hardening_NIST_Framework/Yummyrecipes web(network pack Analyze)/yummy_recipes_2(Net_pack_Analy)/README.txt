In this part of my portfolio a fictional website "yummyrecipesforme.com" e-commerce site again attacked by the attacker, but this time the attacker is the company employer who using the brute force attack to finally the get the credentials and logins of the admin pannel and by adding the malicious Javascript code that asked the customer to downoald the file as the result of downloading it routes the traffic from the customers device to the fake url "greatrecipesforme.com" that 
give all the seller recipies for free, to monitor the internet traffic as a Security Analyst I used tcpdump tool to analyze the captured data packet in the log file.
